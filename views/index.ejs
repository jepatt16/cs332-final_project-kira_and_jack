            <p class="m-2">The Java Barn is a student-run music venue at St. Lawrence University that was
              established in 1993. It is a well-known venue among touring bands all over the United States. We have
              hosted bands such as Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Ani DiFranco, Guster, Dave Matthews Band, and
              Twiddle.</p>
            <p class="m-2">In the early-mid 1980s, there was a popular folk music scene, especially in
              northern New York state. A group of students at SLU who were interested in having live music at the
              school, petitioned and established a coffeehouse in Payson Hall, one of the school’s buildings. They lived
              in a dormitory at 3 University Avenue, and thus the Theme Housewas created. Shows typically took place on
              Friday and Saturday nights and the tenants routinely made the 10-minute “trek” between their residence and
              Payson to facilitate the shows.</p>
